<h2 class="sub-title">The ternary trigger TTBL-22</h2>
<h2 class="sub-title">Usage</h2>
<p>
Building of ternary logical units (registers, adders, etc.) from binary logical units.
</p>
<p>
This trigger has 2 logical inputs, a controlling input (reset) and 2 outputs.
</p>
<p>
Its architecture is made of 2 AND, 2 NOT and 2 OR logical units. 
</p>
<h2 class="sub-title">The logic circuit:</h2>

<h2 class="sub-title">Functioning principle:</h2>
<ol>
<li>The circuit has 3 steady states of output Q+Q- (0,0), Q+Q- (1,0), Q+Q- (0,1)</li>
<li>Set up of outputs is based on the following rules:
  <ol>
  <li>IF S+S (1,0) THEN outputs are set to Q+Q- (1,0), Here, if we change S+ to 0, then outputs will remain unchanged, that is Q+Q - (1,0);</li>
  <li>IF S+S (0,1) THEN outputs are set to Q+Q- (0,1), Here, if we change S- to 0, then outputs will remain unchanged, that is Q+Q - (0,1);</li>
  <li>IF S+S (1,1) THEN outputs are set to Q+Q- (0,0), Here, if to change S + to 0 and S - to 0 outputs will remain unchanged, that is Q+Q- (0,0);</li>
  </ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="sub-title">Advantages:</h2>
<ul class="markered">
  <li>The ternary trigger is built on existing binary logical units;</li>
  <li>Simple integration with binary devices;</li>
  <li>Optimal implementation: 1 ternary bit is made from 2 binary bits.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="sub-title">Disadvantages:</h2>
<ul class="markered">
  <li>Number of logical units required for ternary trigger is bigger than that required for 2 binary RS triggers</li>
  <li>2 channels for 1 ternary bit are required</li>
</ul>
